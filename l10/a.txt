 Write program stat, which print out file size, number of blocks allocated, and reference count.
2. Write a program that lists files in the given directory. When called without any arguments, the
program should just print the file names. When invoked with the -s or -p flag, the program
should print out the size and permissions of each file, respectively.
3. Write a program that prints out the last few lines of a file. The program should be efficient,
in that it seeks to near the end of the file, reads in a block of data, and then goes backwards
until it finds the requested number of lines; at this point, it should print out those lines from
beginning to the end of the file. To invoke the program, one should type: mytail -n file,
where n is the number of lines at the end of the file to print.
4. Write a program search that prints out the names of each file and directory in the file system
tree, starting the given directory. It should throw an error if invoked with a file. A sample
output on a fictitious directory foo is as follows
foo
|-a.txt
|-dir1
| |-b.txt
| |-c.txt
|-dir2
|-dir3
|-d.txt
